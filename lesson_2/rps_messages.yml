  Here's how it works: 
                          => 1. You will select your weapon for battle: rock, paper, scissors, lizard or spock. 
                          => 2. The computer chooses a weapon. 
                          => 3. Epic battle ensues...
                          => 4. Only one emerges victorious. 
                          => 5. The first player to reach three victories is crowned 'Champion!'
    
  => Winning Combinations:
                          => Rock     >   Scissors & Lizard
                          => Paper    >   Rock & Spock
                          => Scissors >   Paper & Lizard
                          => Lizard   >   Paper & Spock
                          => Spock    >   Scissors & Rock
